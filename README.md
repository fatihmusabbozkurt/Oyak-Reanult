## Abstract <br />
Oyak Renault faces challenges in production planning for batteries used in Clio E-tech vehicles due to mixed orders, defective batteries, and demand uncertainty. To address these issues, a mathematical model is proposed to optimize the production planning process. The solution involves implement- ing a stock area named as tristock area for inventory holding and utilizing a mathematical model to create a synchronized production schedule that minimizes inventory at the tristock area. The solution is implemented us- ing Excel Solver and validated under different scenarios. The results show that the model effectively optimizes the production planning of batteries, reducing the risk of stock-outs and disruptions in the production line. This project contributes to enhancing production efficiency and alignment between battery production and vehicle assembly at Oyak Renault, improving the overall operational performance of the factory.
